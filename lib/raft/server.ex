defmodule Raft.Server do
  @moduledoc """
  The server which implements raft on a given server.

  I'd prefer the 'node' nomenclature, but `node/0` is already use by Kernel.

  For everyone else's notation: cast is async, call is sync.

  :keep_state means we're going to continue to be in the current state, which is :follower,
  :candidate, or :leader.
